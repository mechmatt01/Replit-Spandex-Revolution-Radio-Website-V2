- For the enable location for weather button is on the page twice and the bigger one should be removed and ensure the correct one is on top of the other elements and has the blurred background so the text is visible similar to the floating players background look and that the corners are rounded to 100% to make it a pill shape and that the text and icon are both centered within the button and the button should only be displayed when the weather/current location label can not load due to not finding the users current location and when this is the case then the weather label and current location label and icons/images elements should be hidden and when the location and weather are able to load then the enable location button should be hidden 

- For the main player background the current size of it should be a little smaller in terms of its width by about 20% of the total width ensuring it is still centered within the site and content 

- And map expanded view is great but the size is bigger which is awesome but it should be bigger in terms of its height as it still doesnt cover/reach the full height as it goes to the bottom of the site but does not go to the top of the site under the nav bar... also when in full screen mode the user should not be allowed to scroll on the site as it should be overlayed as like a full screen popup view and then when closed scrolling on the site should be enabled again... but the user should still always be able to scroll on the map view itself and the expanded view map close button should be displayed and disappears currently and also the map view should fit in the current display/site size and not allowed to scroll left/right so the space that is on the left and right sides when in the normal map view should not be present when in the expanded map view... it basically should expand animatedly out of the current view to take up the full width of the current site/screen/browser view as well as the full height of the current site/screen/browser view along with being under the floating player in the bottom and under the navigation bar on the top of the site... 

- Also the enable location button still has two of the same button and again the bigger one should be removed fully

- Also where is the border for the premium packages for each one of the three? please review the code from a while back this issue stems from the removing of the borders… but ensure that the border issues do not reappear… so maybe look at if the border code for the packages is still present and the gradients and the moving of the gradients and then if it is still present please then maybe redo the border code JUST for the packages to reenable it to be seen for them… and ensure that it works and is seen as a moving gradient as it used to be a few days ago… and reference the files from a few days ago if needed as well as the border code if needed but again ensure only these are reseen and that the orange borders (or whatever the current theme is set to) for the buttons/hover/glow affects are readded without causing the border issue again… as the borders for the 6 boxes for the features and the shows boxes are not present anymore and should be but again without causing the border issue again…

Please ensure these changes are all fully fufilled and verify that they are correct and completed and if not then redo/do them again to make sure they are correct and verified again until they are correct!
