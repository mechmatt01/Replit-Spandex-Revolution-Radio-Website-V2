In the profile section, there should be a left-side selection section in the following order: 1. “Profile”, 2. “Subscription Management” (acceptable if this is two lines, and it SHOULD NOT appear if there is no active subscription), 3. “Submission Requests” (also acceptable if it takes up two lines), 4. “Logout”.  In the “Profile” Section…  
- In this section, the elements should be ordered vertically and, as always, match the theme and design already created on the site.  
- Profile Image (with a button underneath with the themed text “Change” that reveals two dropdown options when clicked): Option 1: Upload from a File (only allow users to choose/upload images here); Option 2: “Spandex Salvation Avatars” (this should be a premium-only feature. If the user does not have an active subscription, the text should be half the size of the button text, right under it, still within the button, stating “Subscription Required.” When clicked, if the user has a subscription, it should display a popup with about 10 to 15 creatively designed rock music-type avatars to choose from. If the user does not have an active subscription, it should direct them to the subscription screen.  
- If the user has an active subscription, place a cool badge next to their profile image, located at the bottom right of the fully rounded circular image, partially on and partially off, resembling a verified checkmark like those used on social media profiles such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.  
- “User Display Name” (Prefilled from Google if signed up with Google)  
- Phone Number (Prefilled from Google if signed up with Google and is present in their Google profile. If not, it should be prefilled with the one used during signup; if still none, then placeholder text should be displayed, allowing the user to enter theirs if they wish.)  
- Email Address (Prefilled from Google if signed up with Google; if not, it should be prefilled with the email address used for signup.)  
- A Save button that saves all profile changes made to the Firebase database. 

In the “Subscription Management” section…
1. Information on the current price they are paying
2. The next renewal date/charge date (it is monthly)
3. Credit card on file with Stripe (last 4 digits and a logo/icon of the card type, like Amex, Visa, Mastercard, etc 
4. A cancel subscription button that cancels their subscription and deactivates it after the current billing cycle ends 
- A pop-up should appear asking them to confirm cancellation if they select this, and only cancel it if they select “Confirm”, not “Cancel” here 

In the “Submission Requests” section…
- This should just show all their submission requests, information from the exact request submitted, and the date of the request
- If none are present, provide the option to add a new one, and say none are present; however is best to word it 
- This section should also only be active when the user has an active subscription 

Lastly, the “Logout” button…
- Of course which should be in red text always… should just have a popup show up when clicked that confirms the user actually wants to sign out and the options “Logout” and “Cancel” and if they do logout then log them out of the account and refresh the site and bring them back to the main home page
