Task:
- Band song submission form logic

For this task I want to integrate a logic into the site for the current submission form that is shown on the site so that only if the user is Signed Up/Logged In AND approved via a new Boolean field that will be included in each users profile information within the Firebase Firestore database is in a band (upon registration, true/false Boolean in database) and the Boolean is set to true (if not found in the user profile information automatically assume it is False) then the song submission form should show on the site


Task:
- Social media links in footer

For this task I want to add in the footer section of the site and have it displayed in the footer section of the site for every single website page visited a list of social media links like the Twitter (now called X) logo as a button and when tapped it takes you to a link I will provide for each one to the social media page given for each one. For now please just add the following link buttons/icons for each one and set each to the homepage of each social media page (for example for Twitter/X it should currently take you to www.x.com)

These buttons/links/icons should be displayed in the footer section to the far left positioned vertically starting where the text starts on the far left side and then horizontally in a row and for the mobile view positioned respectively so that it looks still normal and good but however it needs to be to fit within the current display for each device size.

List of Social Media Links:
- Twitter/X
    - www.x.com
- Instagram
    - www.instagram.com
- Facebook
    - www.facebook.com
- Reddit
    - www.reddit.com
- TikTok
