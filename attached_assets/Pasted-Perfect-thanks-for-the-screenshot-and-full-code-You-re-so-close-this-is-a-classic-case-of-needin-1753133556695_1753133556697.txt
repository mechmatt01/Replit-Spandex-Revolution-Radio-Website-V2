Perfect, thanks for the screenshot and full code! You’re so close — this is a classic case of needing to “subtract both the top navbar and the bottom floating player” from your map’s height in fullscreen mode. Here’s exactly what’s happening and how to fix it for a true fullscreen overlay effect:

What’s Wrong (Why It’s Not Fullscreen)?
Your map container is styled as:

js
Copy
Edit
style={isFullscreen ? {
  position: 'fixed',
  top: '4rem', // Account for navigation header
  left: 0,
  right: 0,
  bottom: 0,
  height: 'calc(100vh - 4rem)',
  width: '100vw',
  // ...
} : { height: '600px' }}
BUT:

Your floating player (at the bottom left) overlays on top of the map (not under it), so the map is covered by the player.

height: calc(100vh - 4rem) makes the map exactly the height between the top of the page and the bottom edge — it does not subtract the height of the bottom player.

This is why you see the map end at the middle of the page; the rest is filled by your next section (“GET IN TOUCH”).

How To Make Map Cover From Below Nav Bar to Above the Player
You want:

Top: Start below the nav header (4rem = 64px if using pt-16)

Bottom: End above the bottom floating player (however tall it is — say, 72px or whatever it actually is)

The rest: Map is always visible in-between.

1. Find Out the Player Height
Inspect the floating player at the bottom. Let’s say it’s height: 72px (most music bars are about that).

If not, right-click it in the browser, inspect, and look for the CSS height.

2. Use calc(100vh - TOP - BOTTOM) for the Map Height
Update your fullscreen map container’s style:

jsx
Copy
Edit
style={isFullscreen ? {
  position: 'fixed',
  top: '4rem', // nav/header height
  left: 0,
  right: 0,
  height: 'calc(100vh - 4rem - 72px)', // subtract BOTH nav and player
  width: '100vw',
  zIndex: 9999,
  background: 'black',
  overflow: 'hidden'
} : {
  height: '600px'
}}
Replace 72px with your player’s actual height.

3. Make Sure the Inner Map Div is height: 100%
Your map div must use the full height of the parent!

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div
  ref={mapRef}
  className="map-container w-full transition-all duration-300"
  style={isFullscreen ? {
    height: '100%',
    width: '100%',
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? "#1f2937" : "#f9fafb",
    position: "relative"
  } : {
    height: '600px',
    width: '100%',
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? "#1f2937" : "#f9fafb",
    position: "relative",
    borderRadius: '0.75rem'
  }}
/>
You already have this, so you’re good here.

4. Player Layering: Ensure Map is Under the Player
Your player should have a higher z-index than the map or be absolutely/fixed positioned above the map.
If the map is z-[9999], set the player to z-[10000] or whatever is higher.

5. If the Player Is Not Fixed, Just Add a Bottom Margin
If the player is not fixed (rare for music players), you could just use:

css
Copy
Edit
margin-bottom: 72px;
on the map container. But if it’s fixed, use the height: calc() trick.

Example Snippet for Fullscreen Map
jsx
Copy
Edit
<div 
  className={`relative transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out ${
    isFullscreen 
      ? "fixed inset-0 z-[9999] bg-black overflow-hidden"
      : "h-[600px] rounded-lg overflow-hidden"
  }`}
  style={isFullscreen ? {
    position: 'fixed',
    top: '4rem', // header height
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    height: 'calc(100vh - 4rem - 72px)', // subtract header and player
    width: '100vw',
    zIndex: 9999,
    background: 'black',
    overflow: 'hidden'
  } : {
    height: '600px'
  }}
>
  <div
    ref={mapRef}
    style={{
      height: '100%',
      width: '100%',
      backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? "#1f2937" : "#f9fafb",
      position: "relative"
    }}
  />
  {/* ...controls... */}
</div>
Extra: If You Want the Map to Appear Under Both Nav and Player
Make sure nav (header) is fixed or sticky with z-index above map.

Player at bottom: position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; width: 100vw; z-index: 10000;

Map container: as above.

Summary Table
Area	What to Set	Example
Top (Nav)	top: 4rem	top: '4rem'
Bottom (Player)	Subtract player height	height: 'calc(100vh - 4rem - 72px)'
Z-Index	Map < Player	Player z-10k, Map z-9999

What To Do Next
Inspect your player height in browser.

Plug that value into height: 'calc(100vh - 4rem - XXpx)' in your fullscreen map container.

Check z-index of map vs. player.

You’re done!

Try this and you’ll have a perfect fullscreen map overlay, respecting both your nav bar at the top and your music player at the bottom. Let me know if you want a quick copy-paste ready component with these fixes, or if you want it to animate around the player (player collapses in fullscreen, etc.).
